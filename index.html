    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Kai. I'm 22 and recently graduated college. Ever since I was little,
      my brother and I have been making video games together. We started in Unity
      and eventually moved to Unreal Engine. I'm an artist at heart, and I love
      taking the ideas in my head and turning them into something real—that's what
      keeps me passionate about game development.
    </p>

    <p>
      My projects range from replicated multiplayer dungeon crawlers to
      narrative-driven solo horror experiences. I create all of my assets and
      environments from scratch, giving each project its own visual identity.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm always looking to grow, learn more, refine my skills, and create better,
      higher-quality projects.

      <li>Randomly generated dungeon focused on exploration</li>

  <h2>Bosses</h2>
  <br>
  <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="UnhallowedBosses.mp4">
  </video>
  <p> Boss showcase! First boss is the Gravemound. An ape looking amalgam consisting of tombstones, bones and anything else you'd find in a graveyard. 
    The model was made by my brother Shane. I weight painted and added animations from online as well as the AI behavior. Second boss 
    is the reaper. A skeletal warlock that throws magic at you, summons skeletons, raises bones from the ground as an AOE attack and fades into
    the abyss only to come back at you with his scythe. The skeletal assets were made by Shane as well, but I made and painted the cloak,
    by running a cloth simulation over the skeleton. I then painted the cloak and the skeleton, weight painted it and gave is some animations 
    as you can see below as well as some custom ones. </p>

    <p class="middle-text">
      Here are some animation retargets for the boss, the reaper. Once characters are rigged and weight painted we retarget them mostly using
      animations from Mixamo. </p>

    <h2> Phyics Handle </h2>
    <img src="UnhallowedPhysicsHandle.gif">
    <p> A pysics handle system where you could pick up boxes, crates, plates, chairs, and any furniture you could think of. The only problem
      was you could stand ontop of something you're holding and fly.
    </p>

<h2> Map Showcase </h2>
  <video width="1080" height="720" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="UnhallowedMapShowcase.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
We have two areas. One is the procedurally generated tile based dungeon (the snowy area with pink fog). The second area is a lush green area.
Exluding the enemies, I made all the assets in blender. I made the foliage in blender as well and used Unreal's foliage system to place it.

  <strong>Forest</strong> <br>This map is very simular to Unhallowed randomly generated map. It uses the same algorithm except instead of instantiating 
      blueprints at tile locations it instantiates entire levels creating a much more expansive environment. </p>
<br>
  <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="HalloweenieBuiltMap.mp4">
  </video>
      <strong>Town</strong> <br> This is a built map. Everything is hand placed, other than the foliage that was painted it. It features a fort
    a town, a station, and the entrance to mines </p>
    <br>
      <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="HalloweenieMines.mp4">
  </video>
      <strong>Mines</strong> <br> From the edge of town, the entrance to a mineshaft. Explore the mines, find dynamite to clear rocks,
    but beware, something dwells beneath. </p>

       <strong> Chaos Physics! </strong> <br> Maybe this explosion was a little underwhelming, but this clip showcases basic chaos physics in Unreal Engine. Basically it takes
    a static mesh and breaks it up, and applies physics and colliders to the individual pieces. This clip is just a little test to clear
    areas in our mines map. Pretty cool nonetheless. </p>
